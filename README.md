# Goosica
## Notes
Make sure to include ffmpeg executables in the app/bin folder:
1. Go to [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (the standard source for Windows builds).
2. Look for the "ffmpeg-git-full.7z" or "ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip".
3. Download it and extract it to the app/bin folder.
This way, the Goosica can download and convert the audio files into mp3.
